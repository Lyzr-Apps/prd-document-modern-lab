COMPLETED

Chat interface has been fixed with the following improvements:

1. Welcome message displays on page load
2. Response rendering supports multiple formats:
   - response.message (text)
   - response.result.text (text)
   - response.result.response_type === 'qa' (structured Q&A)
   - response.result.extracted_rules (rules table)
   - response.result.compliance_score (compliance report)
   - Error display for failed API calls
   - JSON fallback for unknown formats

3. Enhanced error handling with visible error messages
4. Console logging for debugging
5. Test page created (src/test-agent.html)
6. Testing guide created (TESTING_GUIDE.md)

The chat should now display responses properly. If you still don't see responses:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify VITE_LYZR_API_KEY is set in .env
- Check if agent credits are available (previous error was 429 - credits exhausted)
